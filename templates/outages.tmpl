		<h1>2015-04-17</h1>
		<h2> What happened </h2>
		<p> NotABug.org web front-end was down between 17:00 and 19:00 CEST. It was impossible to view any of the NotABug.org web content. Git pulls and pushes were unaffected.</p>
		<br>
		<h2> What caused it </h2>
		<p> The Gogs software crashed and the monitoring software responsible for restarting it automatically was faulty causing a restart loop.</p>
		<br>
		<h2> How has this been addressed </h2>
		<p> <ul>
			<li> The monitoring software has been adjusted such that a restart loop should be less likely.</li>
			<li> Investigations are ongoing to find the root cause of the crash. </li>
		</ul>

		<h2> What happened </h2>
		<p> NotABug.org web front-end was down between 17:00 and 18:00 CEST. It was impossible to view any of the NotABug.org web content. Git pulls and pushes were unaffected.</p>
		<br>
		<h2> What caused it </h2>
		<p> We currently believe that a bad merge of one of Gogs' dependencies caused a problem with the application. At the time the only person who could fix the problem was off at a party. There was no monitoring. Additionally the error page offered no recourse making it seem like we had just gone away.</p>
		<br>
		<h2> How has this been addressed </h2>
		<p> <ul>
			<li> The dependencies of Gogs were reverted to known-good versions. </li>
			<li> More people were given access to troubleshoot the Gogs instance for NotABug.org. </li>
			<li> Basic monitoring was put in place which will be improved in the future. </li>
			<li> A <a href="{{AppSubUrl}}/error/error.html">better error page</a> was created with contact information. </li>
		</ul>
